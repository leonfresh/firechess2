Most chess players analyze their games wrong. They plug a game into an engine, scroll through the moves, see where the evaluation changed, think "oh, I should have played that," and move on. Two weeks later, they make the exact same mistake.

Sound familiar? Here's how to analyze your games in a way that actually sticks.

## The Problem with Engine-Only Analysis

Engines are incredible tools. Stockfish can see 30+ moves deep and evaluate positions with superhuman accuracy. But there's a fundamental problem: **the engine doesn't know why you made a mistake**.

When an engine shows you that 14.Nf5 was better than your 14.Be3, it doesn't tell you whether:

- You didn't consider Nf5 at all
- You considered it but rejected it for the wrong reason
- You were in time trouble and played too fast
- You misunderstood the position entirely

The *reason* for the mistake is what you need to fix. The engine only shows you the *result*.

## A Better Analysis Process

### Step 1: Replay Without an Engine First

Before opening any analysis tool, replay your game from memory. At each critical moment, write down (or mentally note):

- What was I thinking here?
- What alternatives did I consider?
- Where did I feel uncertain?

This takes discipline, but it's the most valuable step. Your own thought process during the game is information that no engine can provide.

### Step 2: Identify Critical Moments

Not every move deserves deep analysis. Focus on:

- **Turning points** — where the evaluation shifted significantly
- **Decisions** — positions where you had 2-3 reasonable options
- **Time pressure moves** — moves you played quickly in a complex position
- **Opening deviations** — where you left known theory

Mark 5-8 critical moments per game. If you try to analyze every move deeply, you'll burn out and remember nothing.

### Step 3: Use the Engine Surgically

Now turn on the engine, but only for your marked critical moments. For each one:

1. Look at the engine's top move
2. Understand *why* it's better (not just that it is)
3. Compare it to what you played
4. Identify the thinking error that led you astray

**Example of good analysis:**

> "I played 14.Be3 because I wanted to develop my bishop. The engine preferred 14.Nf5 because it attacks g7 and d6 simultaneously, and Black can't defend both. My mistake was focusing on general development when there was a concrete tactical opportunity. I need to check for forcing moves before making quiet moves."

**Example of bad analysis:**

> "Engine says 14.Nf5 is +1.2, I played 14.Be3 which is +0.4. Okay, noted."

The first analysis will change your thinking. The second won't.

### Step 4: Categorize Your Mistakes

After analyzing several games, patterns emerge. Common categories:

- **Tactical oversights** — missed forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks
- **Positional misunderstandings** — wrong plan, bad piece placement
- **Calculation errors** — saw the idea but miscalculated a variation
- **Time management** — good position but blundered under time pressure
- **Opening preparation** — played a suboptimal move in a known position

Knowing your dominant error type tells you what to study. If 60% of your mistakes are tactical, puzzle training will help more than studying strategy books.

### Step 5: Create an Action Item

Every analysis session should produce at least one concrete takeaway:

- "Before playing a quiet developing move, check all captures and checks first"
- "In IQP positions, always consider d4-d5 pawn breaks"
- "Stop playing a4 in the Sicilian — it weakens b4 and doesn't achieve anything"

Write it down. Review your action items before your next game. This is how analysis translates into better play.

## How Many Games Should You Analyze?

Quality over quantity, always.

**Deeply analyze 2-3 games per week** rather than superficially checking 20. A thorough analysis of a single game — where you understand every critical moment — is worth more than a quick engine check of ten games.

For players who want to improve consistently:

| Games Played per Week | Games to Analyze Deeply | Quick Engine Scan |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 3-5 | 1-2 | All |
| 5-10 | 2-3 | All |
| 10-20 | 3-4 | Losses + interesting wins |
| 20+ | 4-5 | Losses only |

Always prioritize your losses and unexpected draws. Wins feel good but teach you less.

## Bulk Analysis: When It Makes Sense

Deep, manual analysis is ideal but time-consuming. There's a complementary approach: **bulk scanning** across many games to find patterns.

Instead of analyzing each game individually, you scan 50-100 games and look for:

- **Repeated positions** where you consistently err
- **Average accuracy** by game phase (opening, middlegame, endgame)  
- **Tactical pattern gaps** — specific motifs you keep missing
- **Rating correlation** — whether your losses have common themes

This bird's-eye view reveals systemic weaknesses that game-by-game analysis can miss. You might discover that your accuracy drops sharply after move 35, suggesting endgame study is needed. Or that you consistently lose 40 centipawns in certain opening structures.

## The Best Tools for Analysis

### For Deep Analysis

- **Lichess Analysis Board** — free, uses Stockfish, great for move-by-move review
- **Chess.com Game Review** — provides human-readable insights (premium feature)
- **A physical board** — seriously, replaying games on a real board improves memory

### For Bulk Pattern Detection

- **FireChess** — scans your games for repeated mistakes, opening leaks, missed tactics, and endgame errors. Runs Stockfish 18 in your browser for privacy.
- **Chess.com Insights** — shows trends over time (premium feature)
- **Custom PGN analysis** — for tech-savvy players who want to build their own scripts

### For Targeted Training

- **Puzzle training** (Lichess, Chess.com) — fixes tactical weakness
- **Endgame trainers** (Lichess Practice, chess endgames app) — fixes endgame weakness
- **Opening trainers** (Chessable, drill mode tools) — fixes opening weakness

## Putting It All Together

Here's a weekly analysis routine that works:

**Monday:** Quick scan — review weekend games with an engine, note big mistakes
**Wednesday:** Deep analysis — pick your most instructive loss and go through the 5-step process
**Friday:** Pattern review — review your action items from the week, scan your recent games for recurring patterns
**Weekend:** Play and apply what you've learned

The key is **consistency over intensity**. Thirty minutes of focused analysis three times a week beats a five-hour marathon once a month.
